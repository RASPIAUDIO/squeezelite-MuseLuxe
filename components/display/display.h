/* 
 The displayer is not thread-safe and the caller must ensure use its own 
 mutexes if it wants something better. Especially, text() line() and draw()
 are not protected against each other.
 In text mode (text/line) when using DISPLAY_SUSPEND, the displayer will 
 refreshed line 2 one last time before suspending itself. As a result if it
 is in a long sleep (scrolling pause), the refresh will happen after wakeup. 
 So it can conflict with other display direct writes that have been made during
 sleep. Note that if DISPLAY_SHUTDOWN has been called meanwhile, it (almost) 
 never happens
 The display_bus() shall be subscribed by other displayers so that at least
 when this one (the main) wants to take control over display, it can signal
 that to others
